# Swift Language

## Code Editor

* XCode is the default choice.
* Sublime Text provides a better view of the files but requires print statements to view the result.

### XCode
* View is per playground.
* Auto Code format is not available.

### Sublime Text
* Fast
* Auto-completion is broken.  Uninstalled because it doesn't work and it slows down typing.
* Crashes occasionally with the error "command line cannot be assembled, too long" but manageable.

## Using Playgrounds
* Create one playground with multiple pages under it. This will allow you to work with different examples that is categorized in a single playground project.

## Approach
I'm using Sublime Text primarily, and if the code gets an error, I switch to using Xcode to help me better understand what the problem is.
